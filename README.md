# ICME2023 《FlowText: Synthesizing Realistic Scene Text Video with Optical Flow Estimation》
 ## Get Started
 To setup the environment, we use `conda` to manage our dependencies. Our developers use `CUDA 11.1` to do experiments. You can specify the appropriate `cudatoolkit` version to install on your machine in the `environment.yml` file, and then run the following to create the `conda` environment:
 ```
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 ```
